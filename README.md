# create_web_template
### Created By; Ryan Gilluley

## Brief Description
Simple script to create file and directory template structure for static front end web development with bootstrap CDN included.

## Usage
Run the script after giving execute permissions.
```
chmod +x create_web_template.sh
./create_web_template.sh
```

Best way to use this script is to make an alias for it so you can run it where ever you like.
Add the line to your .bashrc and point it to where the script is located. 
```
alias wt="~/create_web_template.sh"
```

## Future Plans
- Add options to setup
    - Allow choice of weather to add bootstrap CDN or not
    - Ask weather to use CSS, SASS or SCSS and create necessary files
    - Add different structures
